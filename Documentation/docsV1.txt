This is the documentation for my little project :)
This will be split up into sections so its easier to Ctrl + F and find what you want. (This is my first time writing so sorry if its hard to understand, any feedback is appreceated).

How to enter commands and arguments:
	So at program startup you will be met with a prompt "Input your instruction: "
	After you input your instruction, you will be asked to input an argument, IF your instruction doesnt need an argument just simply press enter,
	IF your instruction needs an argument, you should input it, instruction specific arguments will be specified for each function separatly, some functions WILL need a second argument to function properly.

Function 1: shutdown:
	This function will shutdown, restart or put the computer into hibernation, you will need to specify the arguments yourself though,
	I am planning to make it to make it less user friendly but I will include some basic arguments:
		/s - shuts down the computer
		/r - restarts the computer
		/l - logs off the current user

Function 2: open:
	This function will open any program you specify in the argument, for any NON-Windows applications or features you will have to find the path to the executable
	I intend on finding a workaround to this in the near future
Function 3: sendmessage:
	This function is a bit more complex, it will send a message to any window current or specified window,
	to send a message to the current window use the current argument, and followed by another argument of what you want to do
	the arguments:
		current, close - closes the current window.
		specfic, close - closes the window you specify, and will require a second argument, which you will simply input the name of the window you want to close

Thank you for your passion and support - aqua.
